# HOTSPOT
HOTSPOT is a hierarchical host prediction tool for plasmid contigs using Transformer.

HOTSPOT can learn the gene content features of the input DNA sequences based on deep learning classifiers. Using these features, HOTSPOT will predict the taxonomic lineage information of the input. There are 115 classifier models in all, each corresponding to a taxonomy tree node. To use HOTSPOT, you only need to input contigs of plasmid origin into the program.
